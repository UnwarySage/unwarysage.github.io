## Breakfast And A Conversation
Waking up, our three pilots meet Commander Hadura over breakfast. She spoke more about the sniper campign,
and Zephyr started to collate the data that Commander Hadura and Patience could provide, in an attempt to model the movements of the sniper.
She also explained about the grey towns, the wildcat settlements formed from those who walked away from Patience's guidance to strike out on their own.
Officially, they are cut off, but unoffically there a thriving barter economy, Evergreen residents trading printer favors, and the grey towns providing non-staple foods. Jacob Merrick is a leader amongst these settlements.

> As the Union Peacekeepers, the pilots duties are to do the most good for as many as possible. They were summoned by Patience, but their objective is to remedy the situation holistically. 

Splinter groups such as Jacob Merrick's are interesting to the pilots, but Patience has scheduled them to meet with Chief Engineer Castor Fielding, who provides them an update on what the colony has done to protect it's workers and infrastructure, without letting the
the raiders drive them entirely behind the walls and miss the late spring harvests.
Armor plating on crucial vehicles and drones, shielded canopies to protect workers in the field, and a network of surveillance cameras to attempt to provide enough warning.
