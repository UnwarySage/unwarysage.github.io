## A Brief Aside.
The official campaign, [No Room For A Wallflower](https://massif-press.itch.io/no-room-for-a-wallflower-act-1) is out. I'm reading through my copy and adapting the content to work with the canon I've established. So far, I'm finding the official version fixes most of the gaps in drafts I've worked around.

### Aftermath
Unable to abandon the engineering team to a potential counter-attack, the pilots scanned what information they could find about the attacks on the Grey Towns, and examined the op-for mechs they had splashed.

The mech were unquestionably mechanical at the core, but had trellis-like framework through which the biological chitin had grown. It bled a pale green fluid slowly when pierced.

The pilot of Anvil Gamma was human, with an unfamiliar style of clothing and a intricate henna-analogous design on the forehead and upper face. The design looked somewhere between a cross section of an MRI and calligraphy. 

As the engineers finished up, the pilots loaded the mechs onto the flatbeds for transport to Evergreen and further analysis, then set out with all haste.

### Pitstop
On their way back to Evergreen, a message from Colonial Atache Edena Ji asked them to rendevouz briefly well outside of town. Atache Ji met them there, and  took commands of the wrecks. She ordered her subaltern guards to tear away more of the chitin, and fully reveal the mechanical systems of the wrecks.

She justified these actions as a way to unmask the enemy; they are not Egregorian in nature. She dismissed the pilots to proceed to Liu Maize, while she herself escorted the engineering team and the flatbeds cargo home to Evergreen.

### Scorched Earth
Arriving in Liu Maize, Thunderbird Squadron found it to be in chaos. the distributed outridings of Liu Maize had undergone attacks in the night. Many are dead, several farms have been leveled.
Thunderbird Squadron works through the night and well into the next day, escorting refugees, recording footage and collating reports.

After analysis, they believe groups of five or six combat frames rampaged through this community. 
They didn't wear the chitin armor, and the pilots wonder if Evergreen gaining mech-scale defenders has prompted them to drop the Egregorian pretense. 
Worryingly, the attackers have been using deliberately undershielded reactors. 
Many of the survivors require extensive anti-radiation treatment.

### Strange Attractors
Late afternoon the day after the attack, Thunderbird recieves a new mayday from the Châu Maize outriding, from a personal slate.

> Hello? Is anybody there? This is Albert Châu, out at Châu Miaze. We're completely surrounded by subalterns- Sssh, honey, be quiet.- They're not letting us leave. Please help us. There's hundreds of them.  

The pilots hurry to the confirmed coordinates, and find a slowly revolving gyre of subalterns and drones.
The ones on the periphery shuffle in circles, looking for a way deeper in, while the ones at the core are locked in place by the press of those behind. 

The [Châus](https://twitter.com/Lancer_RPG/status/1370044406917689344/photo/2) had barricaded themselves into the farmhouse, and weren't visible to the pilots initially. 
Pilot Lyndale surveys the local frequencies, and finds there is a a transmitter inside the farmhouse that seems to be drawing the subaltern swarm.

Further probing reveals it to the Châus' comp-con unit, which has an aberrant account on it, taking up all it's computational and communicative resources. Pilot Lyndale made an attempt to override the anomaly, but made little progress other than retrieving the account id, `Beggar1`.
Meanwhile, pilots Sen and Krell managed to force their way into the passive swarm of subalterns, and started to extract the Châus.

Pilot Lyndale recieved a stream of threatening and incoherent chatter from `Beggar1`, demanding that the pilots disengage, surrender or evacuate, threatening airstrikes, and claiming to represent Union.

>///Notice::: THROW DOWN YOUR WEAPONS. IT IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. I AM UNION I AM PEACE. HELP IS ON THE WAY.

Finally, shortly after the last of the Châus were carried out, the comp-con unit went silent, and a moment later overvolted it's powercells and detonated explosively.

The subalterns began to disperse, slowly meandering eastward and ignoring all commands to halt. 

The remains of the comp-con were recovered, and the Châus escorted to Liu Maize. The pilots worried this was a diversion, and resolved to return to Evergreen post haste.
