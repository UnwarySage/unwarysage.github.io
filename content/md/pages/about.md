## Glimmers And Musings
This is the blog of a programmer, a nerd and a writer. By sheer dumb luck, these three happen to be the same person.

## Purpose
I want to improve my development skills, and running my own blog seems to be a good way to go about it. I've chosen to write in Markdown, and transitioned from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) so I could dig under the hood more. (I'm principally a Clojure dev)


## Content
I'll be posting creative writing and RPG stuff, software nerdery with an emphasis on Clojure, Godot Engine, and Linux.
