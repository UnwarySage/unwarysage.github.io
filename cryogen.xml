However, I didn't want to go back to the standard GitHub Pages Jekyll workflow. I found my relative inability to tinker constraining,
as I didn't know the underlying language, namely Ruby. Jekyll is a fine project, but I'm principally a Clojure dev,
and I want to feel like I own my blog, and that means the code that powers it.</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
