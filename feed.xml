They have secured one piece, in its shrine in the center of a labyrinth, and have in their possession a second piece: a pin, of grey-black stone, that utterly cancels and nullifies magic.
They seek its matching counterpart in the Underdark, based on the dying words of a burning halfling.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://unwarysage.github.io/posts/2018-09-29-lonely-kingdom-dramatis-personae/</guid><link>https://unwarysage.github.io/posts/2018-09-29-lonely-kingdom-dramatis-personae/</link><title>Lonely Kingdom, Dramatis Personae</title><description>PreambleSorry for the silence, starting the semester blew a hole in a lot of my well laid plans.
